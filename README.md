## Prime number challenge 

Goals: </br>
*  Finds all the prime numbers between 1 and 1000.</br> 
*  Sums all the prime numbers that you found between 1 and 1000.</br> 
*  The `main` function should return the sum of all prime numbers.

## Comments
* A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 etc are prime numbers. </br> 
4 for example, is not a prime number since 4 is divisible by 2. 4 / 2 = 2. 
* Bonus points for a more functional approach in your code. For example, try to use array functions such as map, filter or reduce.
